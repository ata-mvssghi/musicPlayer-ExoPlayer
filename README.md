## Overview

Welcome to the Music Player App repository! This Android application is designed to provide users with a seamless music playback experience. The app allows users to grant permissions to access their internal storage, fetch songs, and organize them in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Song List Fragment:** Displays a list of songs fetched from the user's internal storage. The list is presented in a Recycler View within a Songs List Fragment.
  
- **Song Preview Fragment:** Features a Seek Bar and control buttons (play, pause, next, back) to facilitate playback control. This fragment is designed to provide a preview of the currently playing song.

- **Service Class:** Utilizes a service class to enable push notifications and ensure that the app continues playing songs even after it has been closed. This enhances the user experience by allowing seamless music playback.

- **Notification with Custom Layout:** When a user clicks on a song in the Song List Fragment, a custom notification is built. This notification includes play, pause, next, and back buttons, along with an image of the current song being played.
  
- **Add songs to favorite -> storing the favortie songs in in room data base and displaying them in another fragment called "FavoriteFragment"
  
- **Searching in songs via room library and quering for songs assigned as favorite songs

- **Exo Player Library:** The app integrates the "Exo Player" library as the primary player for handling audio playback. This powerful library enhances the app's capabilities and ensures a robust music streaming experience.

- **Card View Layout:** Each item in the Recycler View is wrapped in a Card View. This Card View contains essential details about the song, including the song name, singer, album, and an image of the song.
